Password Generator
This Python script provides a simple yet effective way to generate strong, random passwords. It allows users to specify the desired password length and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to ensure high security.

Features
Customizable Length: You can specify exactly how long you want your password to be.

Diverse Characters: Passwords are generated using a combination of:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Digits (0-9)

Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+)

Randomness: Characters are shuffled multiple times during the generation process to maximize randomness.

User-Friendly: Simple command-line interface with clear prompts.

Repeatable: Easily generate multiple passwords without rerunning the script.

How to Use
Save the script:
Save the provided Python code into a file named password_generator.py (or any other .py extension).

Run from your terminal:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using the Python interpreter:
python password_generator.py


Follow the prompts:
The script will ask you to enter the desired length for your password. After generating the password, it will ask if you want to generate another one.

Enter the desired length of the password: 12
Generated Password: s*7P@q!2zE_5

Do you want to generate another password? (yes/no): yes
Enter the desired length of the password: 16
Generated Password: 9#R$tU&6@LmN!oC^

Do you want to generate another password? (yes/no): no

Code Explanation:

The generate_password() function orchestrates the entire process:

1.Character Storage: It creates a list all_characters containing all possible characters (alphabets, digits, punctuation).

2.User Input: It continuously prompts the user for the password_length, validating that the input is a positive number.

3.Shuffling Characters: random.shuffle(all_characters) is used to randomize the pool of characters.

4.Password Generation: It iterates password_length times, picking a random character from all_characters and appending it to password_list.

5.Finalization: The password_list is shuffled again for added randomness, and then joined into a single string final_password.

6.Output & Loop: The generated password is displayed, and the user is given the option to generate another password or exit.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
