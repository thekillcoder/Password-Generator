# Password-Generator
One of the challenges in managing multiple accounts is generating strong, unique passwords for each one. A strong password typically includes a mix of alphabets, numbers, and special characters. The aim of this project is to create a Python-based Password Generator that allows users to easily generate random and customized passwords.
